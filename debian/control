Description: Open Source Robotics Simulator - Shared files
 Gazebo is a multi-robot simulator for outdoor environments. Like
 Stage (part of the Player project), it is capable of simulating a
 population of robots, sensors and objects, but does so in a
 three-dimensional world. It generates both realistic sensor feedback
 and physically plausible interactions between objects (it includes an
 accurate simulation of rigid-body physics).
 .
 This package contains shared files such as 3d models, worlds and
 robots.
